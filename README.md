This game requires the user to match a "goal value" with their "current value" by clicking on one of four crystal buttons. Each crystal has a hidden value that the user must deduce. If the user increases the current value to match the goal value exactly, they win. If they go above the goal value,they lose. In either result, the game resets with a new goal value and new hidden gem values.
